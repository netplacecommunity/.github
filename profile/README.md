# Welcome to NetPLACE!

NetPLACE (Networks, Ph.D. Life And ComplExity) is a supportive community for graduate and postgraduate students, as well as early-career researchers, in the fields of complex systems and networks. Our goal is to foster interaction, share new developments, and discuss the challenges of the PhD journey.

- **In-Person Events**: Networking and knowledge-sharing at international conferences like NetSci and NetSciX.

## Our Approach
- **Interactive Seminars**: Speakers share their academic experiences and challenges.
- **Community Discussions**: Collaborative problem-solving on common PhD issues.
- **Inclusive Environment**: Encouraging questions and participation from all attendees.

NetPLACE is organized by early-career researchers for students and early-career researchers. Join us to connect, learn, and grow together!
